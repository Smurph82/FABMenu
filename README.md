# FABMenu
This is a simple library used to create a FABMenu. Is it perfect? Probably not for everyone. Is it simple to use? Yes, I think so

##### COMING SOON
* Customize the default TextView background color
* Use custom Views for the FAB menu items.
* Create the ability to show a whole View instead of a Popup menu
* Upload to jcenter so the library is easy to implement.

##### KNOWN ISSUES
